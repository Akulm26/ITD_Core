# Insider-Threat-Detection
The CERT Division, in partnership with ExactData, LLC, and under sponsorship from DARPA I2O, generated a collection of synthetic insider threat test datasets. These datasets provide both synthetic background data and data from synthetic malicious actors.  For more background on this data, please see the paper, Bridging the Gap: A Pragmatic Approach to Generating Insider Threat Data.  Datasets are organized according to the data generator release that created them. Most releases include multiple datasets (e.g., r3.1 and r3.2). Version 3.2 was used for this project.
